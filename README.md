# An impure public good model of local food systems: Aggregative games of four locals
by Yuji Saikai, a PhD candidate at University of Wisconsin-Madison

**Abstract**<br>
Promotion of a technology often encounters a gap between private and public benefits if it has only modest appeal to individuals. Information is crucial at the early stages of the adoption process. At the late phase, what if the society is saturated with the required information for decision making, yet people have not made up their minds or are indifferent? The issue becomes complex if individual decisions involve social interaction. To provide a policy tool for the scenario, we build an agent-based model and emphasize the inadequacy of the gold standard, RCT, for studying complex systems.
